Ingredients
- 4 eggs
- 3/4 cup milk
- 3/4 cup flour
- 1/4 cup sugar 
- Spices as desired (a few options below)
	- Vanilla
	- Cardamom 
	- Lavender flours (ground)
	- Cinnamon 
	- Lemon zest
- Fruits (a few options below)
	- Half and apple sliced into 1/4 inch wedges with brown sugar coating them
	- blueberries 
	- Pears with cardamom
- 1 tsp Brown sugar
- 1 tsp butter

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F and put a Dutch oven in to heat up 
2. Mix eggs, sugar, milk, and flour until smooth
3. Mix in spices to batter
4. Wait for oven to reach tempurature
5. Pull out rack with Dutch oven on it, and coat with the butter. The pan is extremely hot so use caution 
6. Either
	1. Pour the batter into the pan
	2. Put some fruit down first then pour batter over fruits
7. Close oven and cook for about 20min. Pull out when the center looks set. Overcooking just makes it less custardy, undercooking could be liquidy 

The cake will rise on the sides quickly and then deflate when you pull it out. That’s what’s supposed to happen. Could separate from Dutch oven easily. I use seasoned cast iron, YMMV.

You can try changing the recipe by reducing eggs or adding some brown sugar and apples before pouring into the Dutch oven.
