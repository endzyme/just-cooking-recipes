Ingredients 
- 500g flour (425g)
- 375ml water (300ml) - 150g levain (75x2)
- 10g salt

Process
1. Autolyse ≈ 45 min
2. Bulk fermentation ≈ 4 hrs (pull and fold 20-40min)
3. Shaped with 4 folds and dusted with flour and flaxseed meal
4. Proof ≈ 16 hr in fridge in loaf pan 
5. Cooked 35min @475 with pan of boiling water for moisture

```ad-note
**Crumb:** seems like well proofed, even bubbles. Maybe a tad under proofed with the small bubbles.

```ad-hint
- I should have scored again before baking because the proofing left the score mark flat. The bread broke on the side too at the seam of the loaf pan. 
- I should have dusted with flour only and then sprinkled flaxseed meal on the top so that the shaping didn’t get a lot of the flaxseed unevenly distributed into the loaf. 
```
