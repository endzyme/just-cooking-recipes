Tips
- You can make green enchilada sauce with tomatillos as the base instead of the tomato sauce. Either buy crushed tomatillos in a can or whole tomatillos in a can just simmer them down and blend them to form a sauce. With green enchilada sauce, you will likely need something like jalape√±os or Anaheim peppers or some kind of Serano pepper for added heat instead of chili powder. You will also want to add about a 2 tbsp of lime juice (fresh squeezed, about one lime)
